# WEB102 Prework - Sea Monster Crowdfunding

Submitted by: Mariah Gonzales

Sea Monster Crowdfunding is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: 7 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [ ] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [ ] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [ ] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] The Our Games section has a search bar that, when the magnifying glass is clicked, allows the user to display only games who's name includes their search input. If there are none that match, a message indicates that to the user and encourages them to try another search.
* [ ] The buttons in the Our Games section have styling implemented for their general appearance as well as when they are hovered over by the user.

## Notes

Implementing the search bar was a bit difficult, as I had no experience with creating one. After doing some research, I was finally able to figure it out, and even created a magnifying glass button that enters their search input to generate their output.
